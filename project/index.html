					<p>I enjoy spending my free time playing the guitar, which allows me to express my creativity through music. I also love playing football, especially in a defensive position. I like the challenge of reading the game, stopping attacks, and helping my team stay organized at the back.

					<P> I am actively preparing for a career in Photoshop and video editing by learning new techniques and improving my creative skills. I regularly explore tutorials, practice editing projects, and study professional work to understand different styles and trends. I focus on mastering tools like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro to create high-quality visual content. This ongoing research and hands-on practice are helping me build a strong portfolio and move closer to my goal of working in the creative media industry.</P>
